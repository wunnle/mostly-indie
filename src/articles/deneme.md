title: "Steam Winter Sale + Local Multiplayer"

It’s happening– the **third** blog post of the year! One of my resolutions for 2018 is definitely to write here more often…

I’m still playing a lot of games, but I’ve been too lazy too often and writing here usually feels harder than just snapping a picture of my screen to share as an Instagram story every time I start a new game these days.

Anyways, **Steam Winter Sale** is here once again to make us poor but happy. During Steam sales, I generally have an equal number of games I DO WANT and games I want other people to want (a.k.a. I recommend), when they are on sale.

I’ve been playing a lot of multiplayer games this year, so I decided to collect them under a curation list (which is now a thing with the new changes to Steam Curators) to recommend you guys a bunch of games at once, so check it out here.  All of the titles on the list are currently on sale. I named the list Local Multiplayer since I played almost all of these only locally, but most of them will also work online.

Don’t forget to follow my curator page and subscribe to my channel for daily fried egg recipes.
