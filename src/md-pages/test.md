ðŸ‘‹ Hello, this is my blog! 

I usually play and look for games that look pretty and tell a good story with calm mechanics (i.e. as little shooting as possible), but also minimalistic puzzle or strategy games to clear my mind.  

I always like to discover new indie gems, and talk more about my current favorites, so feel free to get in contact by clicking on the icons at the bottom of this page.
